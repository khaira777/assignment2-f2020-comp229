<p>
        There is Electronic Medical Records(EMR), which stores clients' medical records in Canada; however, since EMR
        is sometimes incomplete or people think it is difficult to access EMR, few Canadians are using this system. 
        To solve this problem, we developed system that will enable people to add and manage a medical record safely
        and quickly by receiving an EMR from the doctor. Additionally, people can fully understand their medical records, 
        which are explained with patient-friendly terms.Clients would simply have to request access from their doctor 
        and a code will come up which allows them to register/login into an account to access their medical records.

	This project was based on making the requirements for developing the software that will use face recognition technology 
    to keep the record of attendance of the employees. The software will also use GPS to confirm the userâ€™s position and collect
